        <h2 id="2024">2024</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Pattern Recognition / William Gibson</h3>
                <p>Once again, the year of publication (2003) is relevant. Gibson began this book before 9/11/2001; he felt compelled to reconstruct it after the world changed. The novel is a contemporary (to its time) techno-cultural-thriller. It would have been too counterfactual to forge ahead. So, 9/11 looms very large here. It was a surprising and sobering experience, to look back at this time, trying to remember some of what the country and world experienced then. A good book. I haven't read Gibson's earlier novels, but what he wrote when a little older and wiser is humane and restrained, in ways that interest and surprise me.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Much Ado About Nothing / William Shakespeare</h3>
                <p>As the Bard goes, this is a trifle, but still clever and canny. Shakespeare understood people.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Time Machine / H.G. Wells</h3>
                <p>Eerie. A window into the past, as the past dreams dark visions of its future. Where are we now? Published in 1895.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return / Marjane Satrapi</h3>
                <p>A great follow-up to Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood. Satrapi share the humor, calamity, and hope that defined her adolescence and young adulthood, as an Iranian in the West and a Westerner in Iran.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Nightbirds on Nantucket / Joan Aiken</h3>
                <p>The tale of Dido Twite's post-Battersea adventures. A tough, kind, coffee-drinking Londoner weathers a topsy-turvey Moby-Dick tale.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Black Hearts in Battersea / Joan Aiken</h3>
                <p>Old-school children's literature. Joan Aiken had an American existentialist for a father, and maybe that saved her from falling completely into Dickensian conservatism. Anarchic and tough, with wonderful language.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Rouge / Mona Awad</h3>
                <p>A psychological horror novel that is, I guess, a send-up of the beauty industry and beauty / wellness influencer culture. But as is frequently the case with this sort of story, it revels somewhat in the thing it critiques. Sometimes effective, sometimes less so, always breezily readable.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy / Douglas Adams</h3>
                <p>I worried that I might have outgrown Hitchhiker's Guide, but was very happy to discover that I have not. Real anger and sharp satire appears from time to time amidst gleefully absurd plotting and characters, which keeps the book from lapsing into self-satisfied cleverness for the sake of being clever.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Caves of Steel / Isaac Asimov</h3>
                <p>Set in the same future as I, Robot, The Caves of Steel is somewhat more conventional -- a futuristic mystery novel. The same ideas are in play, though, around the ethical and practical implications of AI, and different places that industrial and high-tech civilization might end up.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Palestine / Joe Sacco</h3>
                <p>In the early 1990s, Joe Sacco spent a few months in Gaza and the West Bank, talking to people and traveling around, in order to make this book, ultimately a classic of what I guess you would call graphic journalism. A bleak, difficult, and important book, especially now, in the knowledge that however bad things were then, they are now unaccountably worse. </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>I, Robot / Isaac Asimov</h3>
                <p>Of its time, and also presient in the way of good science fiction. Not really a novel, but a series of somewhat interconnected short stories that describe the rise of robotics and artificial intelligence. Essentialy, this is a mid-twentieth-century exploration of a future for humanity and artificial intelligence, and some of the implications and disturbing historical resonances.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The World And All That It Holds / Aleksandar Hemon</h3>
                <p>A harrowing story of blood, love, and rhetoric, as Stoppard would say. This novel follows a Bosnian refugee, his lover, and his child, across cataclysmic decades of the twentieth century, spanning large parts of central and eastern Europe, and central and east Asia, and ending up in Israel. Echoes of Doctor Zhivago, Slaughterhouse-Five, Les Miserables, but this work has a 21st century Bosnian/American worldview, and is told in its own unique way. Timely - painfully, eternally so.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Baking With Kafka / Tom Gauld</h3>
                <p></p>A collection of single-page comics about books, reading, writing, and publishing. Generally cute and funny. At times I wished for the social conscience and angry political edge that Randall Munroe sometimes brings to XKCD but that isn't what this comic wants to be. Smile-inducing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="2023">2023</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Biography of X / Catherine Lacey</h3>
                <p>Alternative-history with some experimental-fiction gestures. Essentially, this is about art, marriage, solipsism, and all artists being assholes.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Seek You: A Journey Through American Loneliness / Kristen Radtke</h3>
                <p>A graphic novel that is a personal history and journalistic exploration of the causes and effects of loneliness, albeit one that lacks hope or alternatives. Maybe those will be in the sequel.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Such Kindness / Andre Dubus III</h3>
                <p>A bleak representation of American precarity and poverty, particularly of the white working class variety. Also an indictment of any individual response that involves self-pity or rage. I do not agree with all of this book's conclusions -- sometimes rage is earned; the trick, I think, is to find ways to use it generatively, creatively.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Madly, Deeply: The Diaries of Alan Rickman / Alan Rickman</h3>
                <p>A quiet look -- that we probably shouldn't have been granted -- into the day-to-day life of an intelligent, thoughtful person who loved his work even when he hated it; who worked very hard; who looked after people; who showed up. Deceptively, somberly inspiring.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Farthest Shore / Ursula K. Le Guin</h3>
                <p>An intensely philosophical fantasy novel centered on ideas more than on plot or character -- a common characteristic of Le Guin's work. Dense, bleak, slow, yet written with great economy, and with some astonishing passages.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Violin Conspiracy / Brendan Slocumb</h3>
                <p>An uneven but generally engaging violin heist novel, with important insights into the experiences of Black musicians in predominantly white (musical) institutions. Written by a Black violinist and music teacher.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>True Biz / Sara Novic</h3>
                <p>Personal and institutional, this novel follows the head of a residential deaf school, along with some of her students, over the course of a year when the school is under existential threat of closure. Excellent, and for me, a new, retroactive perspective on my own upbringing in Salem, where the Oregon School for the Deaf is located, where I also attending the high school where some of the district's deaf kids were mainstreamed. There is strength in human diversity.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>"Summer's Children" / Richard Shelton</h3>
                <p>A poem of the dispossessed, furious in its indictment of comfortable society, unsparing in its evocation of precarious existence, radical in its conclusions. What does it -- what can it -- mean to live well, and freely, in a world that does not, cannot, work as intended for a large number of people? </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Chivalry / Neil Gaiman and Colleen Doran</h3>
                <p>A dreamlike, elegaic graphic novel, beautifully illustrated, fusing mundane modernity and the ancient stuff of legend. Not sure if there is a real point here -- something about imagination, something about hospitality, something about England...</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Light From Uncommon Stars / Ryka Aoki</h3>
                <p>An unexpected page-turner about a violinist who sells her soul to the devil, and then tries to get it back in exchange for seven other souls, including a young trans virtuoso on the run. Many genres for the price of one, with a hopeful ending. </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>No Longer Human / Osamu Dazai</h3>
                <p>Deliberately, unrelentingly mean, ugly, nihilistic, irredeemable; also fundamentally trustworthy in certain ways, and worth grappling with. </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Color of the Sky is the Shape of the Heart / Chesil</h3>
                <p>A young-adult cult classic in Japan, recently translated into English. A spare, yet enraged and enraging look into the experiences of ethnic Korean families and children living in Japan and in other places.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH / Robert C. O'Brien</h3>
                <p>There should be more children's books written from the perspective of adult characters, which this one is. Deeply strange, experimental, flawed, radical. Tune in, turn on, drop out.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Marvelous Mirza Girls / Sheba Karim</h3>
                <p>An Indian-American girl goes to New Delhi with her mom. Noreen has a strong, funny, unsentimental voice. Somewhat formulaic like all (yes ALL -- I beg you, prove me wrong) contemporary YA/NA, but fun and interesting. The chapter headings include the AQI for the day.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>K-Pop Revolution (book 2) / Stephan Lee</h3>
                <p>The epic continuation -- extending and complicating plot, characters, and themes from the first book.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>K-Pop Confidential (book 1) / Stephan Lee</h3>
                <p>A very fun, predictable/unpredictable, k-pop cinderalla story. Big ideas are handled obliquely, with sensitivity and great restraint.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Recollections Of My Nonexistence / Rebecca Solnit</h3>
                <p>Strange, asymmetrical, unsettled essays. The language is odd but you settle in and eventually are convinced that it all works.</p>
            </li>

        <h2 id="2022">2022</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>The Black Cauldron (book 2) / Lloyd Alexander</h3>
                <p>A brief, spooky, rather sad tale that opens up the world of Prydain a little.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Book of Three (book 1) / Lloyd Alexander</h3>
                <p>Introduces the hapless pig-keeper Taran and his friends and protectors in an amusing, fast-paced tour of Alexander's mythological-fantastical Wales. The names are all Welsh, which means they hang together linguistically in a way fantasy names usually don't.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>A Swiftly Tilting Planet / Madeleine L'Engle</h3>
                <p>Complex, troubling, sometimes profound, of its time which is not entirely apart from our time. The eugenicist undertow is strong, confusing, and morally incoherent. The last Charles Wallace novel, because his author lost him after this -- I like to think he got away.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Project Hail Mary / Andy Weir</h3>
                <p>A fun and interesting hard-science first-contact story. Somewhat enamored of science as the be-all end-all of human identity and purpose. May cause the reader to begin using one-word expressions of emotion in your speech ("excitement!" "frustration!")</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>A Visit From the Goon Squad / Jennifer Egan</h3>
                <p>A book about music, technology, friendship, and the infinitely bizarre possibilities of life. Often sad, often extremly funny.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Chucaro: Wild Pony of the Pampas / Francis Kalnay</h3>
                <p>Lovely, sad, and honest in the way mid-century horse stories can be (see-also Flicka, The Red Pony, etc). Additionally, very political (socialist, perhaps), and very not-American in worldview.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>A Hole Is To Dig / Ruth Krauss</h3>
                <p>A strange little children's book about the purposes of things.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Candy House / Jennifer Egan</h3>
                <p>Generation X considers the post-post-modern age. Like Goon Squad before it, often sad, often extremely funny.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Scattered All Over the Earth / Yoko Tawada</h3>
                <p>Diasporic drifters travel across Europe in search of a man who can speak the language of the lost "land of sushi." A novel of globalized loneliness, contingent connection, unstable chronology, climate apocalypse.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>In the Meadow of Fantasies / Hadi Mohammadi</h3>
                <p>An Iranian picture book filled with wonderful images of multi-colored, frolicking horses; profound in its ethics of hospitality in the context of loss.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Midnight Library / Matt Haig</h3>
                <p>A well-meaning book, meaningful to many, not convincing to me personally. The "Everybody Hurts" of fiction -- helpful to some, unhelpful to others.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Detransition, Baby / Torrey Peters</h3>
                <p>Peters issues a challenge that you want to be worthy of. An uncompromising, angry, nuanced portrayal of three people trying to learn how to be in relation after failing one another in profound ways.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Iron Widow / Xiran Jay Zhao</h3>
                <p>A "burn-it-all-down" YA/NA manifesto that taps into Chinese history and epic fantasy. This tale is for and by the extremely-online gen z-er looking for ways out, or ways in, or both. Intense and sometimes disturbing. Sit up and pay attention.</p>
            </li>

        <h2 id="2021">2021</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Melissa's Story / Alex Gino</h3>
                <p>A sweet and moving story about a trans girl who is determined to get the role of Charlotte in the class play. Middle-grade but worth reading for adults as well.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Funeral for Flaca / Emily Prado</h3>
                <p>A memoir, interesting in that the author is very young and not far removed from the circumstances she depicts. How would she tell the same stories in twenty years? In fifty?</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Earthlings / Sayaka Murata</h3>
                <p>A book that starts out in one place and ends up somewhere completely different. It wants to shake you up and shock you... Existential-domestic-alien-horror. Maybe.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>This Is How You Lose the Time War / Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone</h3>
                <p>A popular, engaging, universe-spanning love story. The novella has such a strong focus on vivid, impressionistic imagery that the particulars of world and of characters remain murky and intangible.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Blanche Among the Talented Tenth / Barbara Neely</h3>
                <p>Another smart mystery story that is "cozy" without being insubstantial.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Blanche On The Lam / Barbara Neely</h3>
                <p>A cozy mystery with sharp social commentary and excellent depictions of food. Somewhat of its time in certain characterizations.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Everywhere Home / Fenton Johnson</h3>
                <p>Essays by a thoughtful writer who observes the world around him with sensitivity and curiosity, and with specific perspectives born of his experiences -- as a gay man who survived the 1990s when his partner and almost all of his friends died; as a kid from Kentucky facing down the Vietnam draft; as a person with an unfulfilled lifelong yearning for religious belonging; as a writer and a teacher.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe / C.S. Lewis</h3>
                <p>A strange, creepy, painful children's book. There is always a thread of despair and of pain in Lewis's writing, even, or maybe especially, when he writes for kids. His books are fucked up in a way that demands to be taken seriously.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Sabriel / Garth Nix</h3>
                <p>A dense YA fantasy novel that takes the reader on a slow, mostly-solitary meander through a dying land. Requires patience. Some good images and sequences, and an interesting girls' school where magic is an elective subject.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>How To Be An Antiracist / Ibram X. Kendi</h3>
                <p>Kendi provides a methodical analysis of the concepts of racism and antiracism, through the prism of his own life experiences and intellectual growth; also suggests the sorts of actions which are racist, or antiracist.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Inspired / Rachel Held Evans</h3>
                <p>Imaginative, generous readings of Bible stories, personal narratives, and smart insights abound.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Man's Search For Meaning / Viktor Frankl</h3>
                <p>One of the essential Holocaust memoirs; also a 20th-century psychiatrist's meditations and case studies pertaining to human life and its value in catastrophic and mundane circumstances.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Dealing With Dragons / Patricia Wrede</h3>
                <p>90s junior fantasy with girl protagonists and dragons. Fun.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Moominvalley Midwinter / Tove Jansson</h3>
                <p>A somewhat off-format Moomin story wherein most of the family and friends are hibernating or away elsewhere. Moomintroll experiences the dark, icy Finnish winter along with a few uncomfortable companions. Stark.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><h3>Dad's Maybe Book / Tim O'Brien</h3>
                <p>Tim O'Brien, author of 'The Things They Carried' and a later-in-life father, writes essays and letters to his sons over the years of their growing up. Topics are wide-ranging, including war, parenthood, politics, writing. He reminds me of some of the veterans whom I have beeen around through work. </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Beowulf: A New Translation / Translated by Maria Dahvana Headley</h3>
                <p>An interesting experiment in translation - stretching language and story to the point of breaking, across multiple dimensions. Enjoyable, though complicated by the unacknowledged appropriation of specific, historically-marginalized linguistic and cultural traditions. These troubles are well-articulated in the review "Whose 'Bro' Is It Anyway?" by Samira Nadkarni, writing for the Ancillary Review of Books.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>A Wrinkle In Time / Madeleine L'Engle</h3>
                <p>Experimental children's fantasy that taps into adult Cold War paranoia and also some more universal dreams and nightmares.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Factory / Hiroko Oyamada</h3>
                <p>A precise and strange study in alienation. Forster says 'only connect,' but what happens to people who just don't? Also insightful and funny on topics such as work and the production of material culture.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>All Systems Red / Martha Wells</h3>
                <p>A popular novella about a misanthropic 'construct' that refers to itself as Murderbot. Fun and kind of sweet, though slight.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Other Half Of Happy / Rebecca Balcarcel</h3>
                <p>Realistic junior fiction. Not one that worked for me because of the ways illness and death were handled (manipulated, used). My worries here are far from unique to this particular book, but rather endemic in the genre. As always, YMMV.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man / James Joyce</h3>
                <p>Difficult but manageable. What stands out is Stephen's almost complete inability to relate to other people -- his crippling solipsism, his lost-ness in his own head.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>March (I, II, III) / John Lewis, Andrew Aydin, Nate Powell</h3>
                <p>Graphic novels about the early activism of John Lewis during the Civil Rights Movement. The story is well-told and illustrated; the main takeaway is of how many people were involved, how enormous each undertaking was, how there was no single person who was 'The Guy.'</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Fire Next Time / James Baldwin</h3>
                <p>This book contains two long essays: "My Dungeon Shook: Letter to my Nephew on the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Emancipation" and "Down at the Cross: Letter from a Region of My Mind." Wide- and rapidly-ranging; eloquent. Challenges the reader to keep up.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Return of the King / J.R.R. Tolkien</h3>
                <p>The individuality of characters begins, at times, to recede before the crushing obligations of entropy and of Fate. This is interesting, and maybe True; also possibly the reason I've always struggled to connect with a little with ROTK. My American need for free will, for choice...</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Brown Girl Dreaming / Jacqueline Woodson</h3>
                <p>A memoir for young audiences, about the author's experiences growing up in the 1960s. Written in verse. Good, effective.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe / Benjamin Alire Saenz</h3>
                <p>YA fiction about two queer Mexican-American teenagers who slowly fall for one another. A kind of period piece, set in the 1980s. It is important to remember the ways we get shaped by specificities of times and place and of course the ways the past isn't dead / isn't past.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Two Towers / J.R.R. Tolkien</h3>
                <p>The great fantasy epic enters its second and possibly most compelling act.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Fire This Time / edited by Jesmyn Ward</h3>
                <p>A collection of essays by mostly young Black writers. A lot of ground is covered, and covered well.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>"What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" / Frederick Douglass</h3>
                <p>Douglass was an astonishing writer of oratory. You can hear this one, just by reading it. Emotionally and intellectually undeniable.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>White Fragility / Robin DiAngelo</h3>
                <p>Though it is predicated on a sort of 'individual change' paradigm for addressing systemic racism -- a paradigm that is often critiqued -- this book has a kind of 101-level value, and conveys useful points like 'shut up and listen,' and 'stop making it about you, it's not about you.'</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Fellowship of the Ring / J.R.R. Tolkien</h3>
                <p>Beauty, horror, honor; allies, enemies, ambiguities -- all the big epic fantasy elements, brought together into modern mythology, brought together like they've been nowhere else.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Becoming / Michelle Obama</h3>
                <p>A study in the pursuit of excellence and a life of meaning. Also honest and reflective about the experience of getting tipped over into a remarkable and deeply strange set of circumstances. 'My independence seems to vanish in a haze...'</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Conjure Women / Afia Atakora</h3>
                <p>An excellent first novel novel about the people living on a southern plantation, before, during, and after the Civil War. Epic and nuanced.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Aeneid / Virgil</h3>
                <p>Arms and the almost-modern man I sing... 'Almost modern' is how a professor described Aeneas to me, and the idea stuck. There is a kind of almost-modern or almost-post-modern tragedy to Aeneas and to this story that I find compelling.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Decameron / Giovanni Boccaccio</h3>
                <p>Pandemic reading. It could have been worse, it could have been happening in medieval Italy.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Hidden Figures / Margot Lee Shetterly</h3>
                <p>A movie by necessity focuses in on a single person or a couple of people. This book is much larger in scope than its film counterpart, providing a powerful sense of the community of smart, driven Black women at NASA's Langley campus, and their legacy.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>The Stars and the Blackness Between Them / Junauda Petrus</h3>
                <p>A lovely YA novel about two queer Black girls, one Trinidadian, one American. It hits some of the same beats as The Fault in Our Stars, but hits them so differently that any resonances are revelatory and not distracting.</p>

                <li>red: "Don't panic."
                    <br>From <cite>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</cite> by Douglas Adams.
                    <br>Context: "The contents of Ford Prefect's satchel were quite interesting in fact and would have made any Earth physicist's eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dogeared scripts for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top. Besides the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb -- a short squat black rod, smooth and matt with a couple of flat switches and dials at one end; he also had a device that looked rather like a largish electronic calculator. This had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen about four inches square on which any one of a million 'pages' could be summoned at a moment's notice. It looked insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words DON'T PANIC printed on it in large friendly letters. The other reason was that this device was in fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor -- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitchhiker would require several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in." <br>(p. 21, <cite>The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</cite>, Ballantine, 2002)</li>
                <li>darkorange: "And so it was. By teaching us to read, they had taught us how to get away." <br>From <cite>Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH</cite> by Robert C. O'Brien. <br>Context: "He was right, and you can see that already we both had the same idea in mind: that his might be the first step toward escape for all of us. <br>[Chapter: The Air Ducts] <br>And so it was. By teaching us how to read, they had taught us how to get away. Justin climbed easily up the open door of his cage and vanished over the top with a flick of his tail. He came back an hour later, greatly excited and full of information. Yet it was typical of Justin that even excited as he was, he stayed calm, he thought clearly. He climbed down the front of my cage rather than his own, and spoke softly; we both assumed that by now the other rats were asleep. 'Nicodemus? Come on out. I'll show you how.' He directed me as I reached through the wire bars of the door and felt beneath it. I found the small metal knob, slid if forward and sideward, and felt the door swin gloose against my shoulder. I followed him up the side of the cage to the shelf above. There we stopped. It was the first time I had met Justin face to face." <br>(p. 128-130, <cite>Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH</cite>, Aladdin, 1986)</li>

                <li>"Heavy Negro Sigh." <cite>Vibe Check</cite>. Sam Sanders, Saeed Jones, Zach Stafford. Episode 80. January 24, 2024. Really interesting discussion of the current cultural moment and its twin problems of (1) nostalgia / stuckness that is preoccupied by the works of the 90s/00s, perhaps caused in part by (2) an underdevelopment / overexposure of all things new, so that they never have a chance to mature, but rather, get flattened, consumed, and then immediately forgotten.</li>
